My name is David Calamaro (They/Them/He/Him) and I am a first year CS student here at Drexel. 
I have always loved technology, even since I was a kid and I first stated to get into programming 
in my freshman year of High school. I would like to eventually work as a mobile app developer at 
Apple or some other company where mobile apps are needed, since I took 2 iOS app development 
courses in my junior year of High school and I found it to be very fun to do.
